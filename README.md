The stepwise in the curves are affected by process of epidemic spreading on important nodes. Different nodes have different infection capabilities. Once important nodes are infected, the spread of the epidemic will be accelerated. Besides, the stepwise would be affected by the time intervals. Here I divided the whole time span into 20 equal-sized steps. If we use smaller time intervals to calculate the number of nodes, the curve would look more smoothly

The differences in spreading speed for each seed node are visible at the beginning of the epidemic. The process of epidemic spreading is from the seed to its neighbors and then to the whole network, so in the beginning, the process is mainly affected by the seed node and its neighbors. Once the epidemic spreads throughout the majority of the network, it already doesnâ€™t matter who is the seed node, who spreads first.
